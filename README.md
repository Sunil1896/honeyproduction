# Honey Production Analysis

# Project Overview
This project analyzes honey production in the U.S. over a specified period. The goal is to identify trends in honey production, assess regional performance, and examine the factors that impact honey production, such as colony numbers, honey yield, and prices.

# Key Objectives:
- Trend Analysis: Examine the production trends over time.
- Regional Analysis: Identify which states or regions are the top producers.
- Factor Analysis: Analyze the factors that impact honey production, such as the number of bee colonies and honey price.

# Tools & Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Data Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for predicting honey yield)
- Data Source: USDA Honey Production Dataset

# Data Source
The dataset is sourced from the USDA and includes information on the following attributes:

- Year: The year of honey production.
- State: The U.S. state in which honey production was recorded.
- Colonies: Number of bee colonies used for honey production.
- Yield per Colony: The amount of honey produced per colony (in pounds).
- Total Production: The total honey produced in the state (in pounds).
- Stocks: The amount of honey stocks available.
- Price per Pound: The price of honey per pound.
- Total Value: The total value of the honey produced (in dollars).

 # Data Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Values: Missing data was handled by either imputing or removing rows.
- Feature Engineering: New variables were created such as production per colony and price to production ratio.
- Normalization: Features such as production and colony counts were normalized for better model performance.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Production Trends
The honey production over the years shows a clear trend of decline due to multiple factors such as colony collapse disorder and environmental changes.

# Conclusion
The analysis highlights the following:

The overall decline in honey production over the years.
The dominance of certain regions in honey production.
How the number of colonies and price fluctuations impact production.
